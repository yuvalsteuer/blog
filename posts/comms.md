Learning a topic should be more time consuming than explaining it.

Over the years I observed fellow engineers feel obligated to explain topics in an overly complicated manner, itâ€™s as if the speaker is looking to justify/excuse the amount of time sunk to understanding a topic.

If youâ€™ve once fallen into this hole, I would like you to know:

**I donâ€™t care if it took you weeks to understand a topic.
I will appreciate the heck out of you for saving me that time.**

A good example from an software engineering context: is when you start by programming a solution, and 300 lines in you realize a much simpler solution exists. You then spend the next 2 hours refactoring your code to the simpler solution. You then explain the solution to your peers, and you start by explaining the original solution, and then you explain how you refactored it to the simpler solution.

> The more complex sounding the explaination the better you look in the eyes of your peers.
> 

This is a short-term outlook on gaining peer respect that sadly many engineers posses. Long term, we all prefer working with great communicators.

Stop **complicating** communication.

 

### A few things I try to stick to

* Use less words not more.
* If you find the need to explain why something is complex; **DONT**
* boil your explanation down to the essential points required for understanding what the hell youâ€™re talking about.
* Instead of explaining task-specific jargon, donâ€™t use it.

If you do this well enough, people will follow up with questions **naturally**.
